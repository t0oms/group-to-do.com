# group-to-do.com

The main functionality of this website is to allow users to create groups where they assign each other tasks. Tasks are assigned in the form of "to-dos," which are meant for a specific user. Each to-do consists of a title, a short description, the user who created the to-do, and the user for whom the to-do is intended.

## Dashboard
When entering the website, the user sees a dashboard that contains all the groups in which the user is a member. Groups created by this user are highlighted in green.

### New Group

By clicking on the "New Group" button, a form opens where the name of the new group must be specified. When the "Create" button is clicked, a new group empty group with no other members is created and added to their dashboard.

## Groups

### To-Dos
When clicking on a group, the first thing the user sees is a list of all the group's to-dos. Highlighted in red are all the to-dos meant for this user.

Users create new to-dos by clicking on the "Create To-Do" button at the bottom of the page. When clicking on the button, the "Create To-Do" form opens. The user must give the to-do a name, a short description, and choose a member of the group for whom the to-do is intended. After clicking the "Create" button, the new to-do is added to the list of the group's to-dos.

When the user completes a to-do assigned to them, they can check it off, and the completed to-do is moved to the "Done To-Dos" section. In the "Done To-Dos" section, users see all the completed to-dos, and they can also uncheck the done to-dos to move them back to the undone "To-Dos" section.
